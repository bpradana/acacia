2. Node removed from tree
3. If closed tab is active, switch focus to parent tab

### Closing a Subtree

2. Parent node and all descendants removed
3. If subtree was active, focus shifts to closest ancestor

### Detaching Subtree
1. User selects "Detach Subtree"

  - Subtle borders between panels

- **Typography**
  - Sans-serif font

- **Icons**
  - Standard navigation icons
  - Chevron icons for expand/collapse
  - Minimalist and consistent icon set

- **Feedback**
  - Hover states for buttons and tabs
  - Loading indicator in address bar
  - Smooth animations for expand/collapse and drag-and-drop

---

## Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation for tree operations
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts for navigation
- High-contrast mode support
- Screen reader-friendly tree structure

---

## Responsiveness
- Sidebar resizable by user drag
- Panels adapt to window resizing
- Scrolling enabled for large tab trees

---

## Performance Considerations
- Virtualized rendering for large tab trees
- Lazy loading/unloading of inactive webviews
- Smooth drag-and-drop without frame drops
